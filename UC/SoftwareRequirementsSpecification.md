# 2. Overall Description
## 2.1. Idea

The Idea of our App is that you can improve the food in the Casino of the DHBW-Karlsruhe by giving constructive critic. We want to make this process happen through an Android App where you can rate your food, leave a comment on your rating, see the ratings of the other people and look whether the food got better or worse to the last time they served it. The idea is to put all these information on a server, also on the server are the login data of every person, that uses the App. Only a verified user can rate the dishes but everyone can look at the ratings. Furthermore there should be a website where the people from the DHBW-Casino can look at the ratings an comments.
